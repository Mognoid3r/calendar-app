# calendar-app

Assignment:
Create a calendar-event application in Node.js in place of java.

################################################################

This assignment was done using Node.js which allowed me to import a library called Inquirer.  

Inquirer is an npm package allowing users to interact with the application through the CLI.  

Prior to building this application I imagined how the user would create an event, review upcoming events, and remove events without a database or a server.  In doing this, my steps were as follows: 
1. Determine how best to capture user interactions
2. Use user interactions to make changes 
3. Create a prototype event as a constructor
4. Create a function to create NEW events when user selects that option
5. Push newly created event into an array of events
6. Review events
7. Give the user the option to remove an event 
8. Loop back through the function to confirm user interactions have been captured 

Finally, I added comments inside the code that evaluated time complexity with respect to each function.
